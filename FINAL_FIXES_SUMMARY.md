# Final Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Saving Status Indicator Restored

**What was done:**
- Added back the save status indicator at the bottom of the editor
- Shows "🟡 Saving..." (amber, pulsing) while typing
- Shows "🟢 Saved" (green, solid) after debounced save completes
- Proper dark mode colors for better visibility

**Implementation:**
```typescript
{isSaving ? (
  <span className="text-amber-600 dark:text-amber-400">
    <span className="animate-pulse">●</span> Saving...
  </span>
) : (
  <span className="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400">
    ● Saved
  </span>
)}
```

### 2. ✅ Hover Controls Fixed and Enhanced

**Problems identified:**
- Event listeners weren't properly attached to editor wrapper
- Block detection was too restrictive
- Z-index was too low
- Controls weren't visible enough

**Solutions implemented:**
- Improved block detection with `.ProseMirror > *` selector
- Added passive event listeners for better performance
- Increased z-index to 50 (from 20)
- Added `pointer-events-auto` to ensure controls are clickable
- Made buttons more visible with:
  - Semi-transparent background (`bg-background/80`)
  - Backdrop blur effect
  - Border for definition
  - Larger size (h-7 w-7 instead of h-6 w-6)
  - Larger icons (h-4 w-4 instead of h-3.5 w-3.5)

**New control styling:**
```typescript
className="h-7 w-7 p-0 hover:bg-accent bg-background/80 backdrop-blur-sm border"
```

**Improved detection:**
```typescript
const handleMouseMove = (e: MouseEvent) => {
  // Find block element
  let block = target.closest('p, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, ul, ol, li, blockquote, pre, .ProseMirror > *')
  
  // Verify it's in the editor
  const prosemirror = wrapper.querySelector('.ProseMirror')
  if (!prosemirror || !block || !prosemirror.contains(block)) {
    return
  }
  
  // Calculate position and show controls
  setHoveredBlock({ top, height })
}
```

### 3. ✅ Highlight Colors - More Options & Dark Mode Support

**What was wrong:**
- Only 7 colors (too few)
- Colors didn't work well in dark mode
- No visual preview of both light/dark variants

**What was fixed:**
- **12 colors** now available (was 7):
  - Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Pink, Orange, Red
  - **NEW:** Teal, Indigo, Lime, Cyan, Fuchsia
  
- **Dark mode support:**
  - Each color has `light` and `dark` variants
  - Light variant for light mode (pastel colors)
  - Dark variant for dark mode (deeper, saturated colors)

- **Better visual preview:**
  - Each color button shows both variants in a diagonal split
  - 6 columns grid (was 4) for better organization
  - Hover effect with checkmark
  - Wider dropdown (w-64 instead of w-48)

**Color structure:**
```typescript
const HIGHLIGHT_COLORS = [
  { name: 'Yellow', light: '#fef3c7', dark: '#713f12' },
  { name: 'Green', light: '#d1fae5', dark: '#14532d' },
  // ... 10 more colors
]
```

**Visual preview:**
```typescript
<button
  style={{ 
    background: `linear-gradient(135deg, ${color.light} 50%, ${color.dark} 50%)` 
  }}
>
  <span className="group-hover:opacity-100">✓</span>
</button>
```
