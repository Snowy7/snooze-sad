## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### **Authentication Flow**
```
WorkOS Auth â†’ useAuth hook â†’ Identity
                                â†“
                         getCurrentUser (Convex)
                                â†“
                         WorkspaceContext
                                â†“
                         UI Components
```

### **Workspace Context State**
```typescript
{
  currentWorkspaceId: Id<"workspaces"> | null
  currentWorkspace: Workspace | undefined
  workspaces: Workspace[]
  isLoading: boolean
  setCurrentWorkspaceId: (id) => void
}
```

### **Permission Checks**
All sensitive operations check user role:
```typescript
const isOwner = workspace.role === "owner"
const canManageMembers = ["owner", "admin"].includes(workspace.role)
```
