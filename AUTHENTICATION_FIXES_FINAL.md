# Complete Authentication Fixes - Final Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ localhost:3000 Redirect After OAuth (Deployed Sites)

**Problem**: Users signing in via Google OAuth from deployed sites were redirected to `https://localhost:3000/dashboard`.

**Root Cause**: The OAuth redirect URI needs to be configured in **WorkOS Dashboard**, not in code.

**Solution**:
- Simplified OAuth functions to only use `WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI` environment variable
- The callback route uses `request.url` to determine correct domain
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: Configure redirect URIs in WorkOS Dashboard:
  - Production: `https://yourdomain.com/callback`
  - Development: `http://localhost:3000/callback`

**Files Changed**:
- `src/lib/workos/auth.ts` - Simplified OAuth redirect configuration
- `src/app/callback/route.ts` - Uses request URL for redirects

### 2. ✅ Email Verification Flow

**Problem 1**: After sign-up, users were briefly shown the verification screen then immediately sent back to sign-in.

**Problem 2**: When entering verification code, users got "user 'email' not found" error.

**Problem 3**: Verification was trying to verify by userId/email instead of using the proper WorkOS flow.

**Root Cause**: Completely wrong implementation of WorkOS email verification flow.

**Correct WorkOS Email Verification Flow**:
1. User signs up/signs in with unverified email
2. WorkOS returns `pendingAuthenticationToken` (not a regular user session)
3. Verification email is sent with a 6-digit code
4. User enters code
5. Call `authenticateWithEmailVerification` with:
   - `clientId`
   - `code` (the 6-digit code)
   - `pendingAuthenticationToken`
6. This **authenticates AND verifies** in one step
7. User is now logged in with verified email

**Solution Implemented**:

#### `src/lib/workos/auth.ts`
- Added `pendingAuthenticationToken` and `needsEmailVerification` to `AuthResponse` interface
- Updated `signUpWithPassword`:
  - Creates user with `emailVerified: false`
  - Attempts authentication to get `pendingAuthenticationToken`
  - If auth fails due to unverified email, sends verification email
  - Returns pending token to client
- Updated `signInWithPassword`:
  - Catches `pendingAuthenticationToken` error
  - Sends verification email if user is unverified
  - Returns pending token to client
- Added `verifyEmailWithCode` function:
  - Uses `authenticateWithEmailVerification` (correct method!)
  - Takes code + pending token
  - Verifies and authenticates in one call

#### `src/app/(auth)/auth/page.tsx`
- Added `pendingAuthToken` state
- Stores pending token when sign-up/sign-in returns `needsEmailVerification`
- Passes pending token to `EmailVerification` component
- Shows verification screen immediately (no flashing back and forth)

#### `src/components/email-verification.tsx`
- Now accepts `pendingAuthToken` prop
- Uses `verifyEmailWithCode` from auth lib (correct implementation!)
- No longer tries to verify by userId/email
- Verification now works correctly

#### Deleted Files
- `src/app/api/auth/verify-email/route.ts` (wrong approach)
- `src/app/api/auth/resend-verification/route.ts` (wrong approach)

### 3. ✅ Sign Out Redirect Error

**Problem**: Console showed "Sign out error: NEXT_REDIRECT" even though sign-out worked.

**Root Cause**: Next.js throws a special error for redirects. The try-catch was catching and logging it.

**Solution**:
- Check if error message contains `NEXT_REDIRECT`
- Re-throw it so Next.js can handle it properly
- Only log actual errors

## Testing Checklist

### Email Verification Flow
- [ ] Sign up with new email
- [ ] Verify verification screen appears immediately (no flashing)
- [ ] Check email for 6-digit code
- [ ] Enter code in verification screen
- [ ] Verify successful authentication to dashboard
- [ ] Try sign-in with unverified account
- [ ] Verify verification screen appears
- [ ] Complete verification
- [ ] Verify login successful

### OAuth Flow (Critical - Test on Deployed Site!)
- [ ] Deploy with correct `WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI` environment variable
- [ ] Sign in with Google from deployed site
- [ ] Verify redirect goes to deployed domain, NOT localhost
- [ ] Sign in with GitHub from deployed site
- [ ] Verify redirect goes to deployed domain, NOT localhost
- [ ] Test from localhost
- [ ] Verify redirect goes to localhost

### Sign Out
- [ ] Sign out from settings
- [ ] Verify no console errors
- [ ] Verify redirect to `/auth`
- [ ] Sign out from command menu
- [ ] Verify works correctly

---

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# CRITICAL: Set these correctly for each environment
WORKOS_API_KEY=sk_...
WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=client_...

# Production
WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI=https://yourdomain.com/callback

# Development
WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback
```

---

## WorkOS Dashboard Configuration

**CRITICAL**: You **MUST** configure redirect URIs in the WorkOS Dashboard:

1. Go to https://dashboard.workos.com
2. Select your application
3. Go to "Redirect URIs" settings
4. Add:
   - `https://yourdomain.com/callback` (production)
   - `http://localhost:3000/callback` (development)
5. Save changes

**Without this configuration**, OAuth will always redirect to the first/default URI configured in WorkOS, which might be localhost!

## How Email Verification Now Works

### Sign Up Flow
```
User signs up
  ↓
Create user (emailVerified: false)
  ↓
Try to authenticate
  ↓
Get pendingAuthenticationToken error
  ↓
Send verification email
  ↓
Return pending token to client
  ↓
Show verification screen (stays there!)
  ↓
User enters 6-digit code
  ↓
Call authenticateWithEmailVerification(code, pendingToken)
  ↓
User authenticated & email verified ✅
  ↓
Redirect to dashboard
```

### Sign In with Unverified Email
```
User signs in
  ↓
Try to authenticate
  ↓
Get pendingAuthenticationToken error
  ↓
Send verification email
  ↓
Return pending token to client
  ↓
Show verification screen
  ↓
User enters 6-digit code
  ↓
Call authenticateWithEmailVerification(code, pendingToken)
  ↓
User authenticated & email verified ✅
  ↓
Redirect to dashboard
```

## Key Differences from Before

### Before (Wrong ❌)
- Tried to verify email by userId
- Used `verifyEmail()` API (doesn't authenticate)
- User had to sign in AGAIN after verification
- Verification screen flashed and disappeared
- No pending authentication token used

### After (Correct ✅)
- Verifies using `pendingAuthenticationToken`
- Uses `authenticateWithEmailVerification()` (verifies AND authenticates)
- User is logged in immediately after verification
- Verification screen stays visible until complete
- Follows WorkOS documented flow exactly

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Still redirecting to localhost after OAuth
**Solution**: Check WorkOS Dashboard configuration. The redirect URIs MUST be configured there.

### Issue: "Invalid redirect URI" error
**Solution**: Make sure the URI in your environment variable EXACTLY matches one configured in WorkOS Dashboard (including protocol and trailing slashes).

### Issue: Verification code doesn't work
**Solution**: Make sure you're passing the `pendingAuthToken` from sign-up/sign-in response to the verification component.

### Issue: User gets logged out after verification
**Solution**: This should not happen anymore. `authenticateWithEmailVerification` handles both verification and authentication.

---

## Additional Notes

- Email verification codes are 6 digits
- Codes expire after a certain time (set in WorkOS)
- Pending authentication tokens expire after a certain time
- If token expires, user needs to try signing in again
- WorkOS handles sending the verification email automatically
- The verification email template can be customized in WorkOS Dashboard

---

## Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying:
- [ ] Set `WORKOS_API_KEY` environment variable
- [ ] Set `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID` environment variable
- [ ] Set `WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI` to production callback URL
- [ ] Configure redirect URI in WorkOS Dashboard
- [ ] Test OAuth from deployed site
- [ ] Test email verification from deployed site
- [ ] Verify no localhost redirects occur
- [ ] Test sign out works correctly
