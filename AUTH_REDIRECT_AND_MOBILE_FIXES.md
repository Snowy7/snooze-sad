# Authentication Redirect & Command Menu Mobile Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Localhost:3000 Redirect After Authentication

**Problem**: After signing in (from deployed site), users were redirected to `https://localhost:3000/dashboard` instead of the correct domain.

**Root Cause**: The `saveSession` function in server actions was being passed a hardcoded redirect URI that included localhost.

**Solution**:
- Removed `saveSession` calls from server actions (`signInWithPassword` and `signUpWithPassword`)
- Server actions can't access the request object directly
- Session management is now properly handled by WorkOS AuthKit
- OAuth redirects are controlled by `WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI` environment variable
- Callback route (`src/app/callback/route.ts`) redirects to `/dashboard` using `request.url` origin

**Files Changed**:
- `src/lib/workos/auth.ts`:
  - Removed `saveSession` and `refreshSession` imports
  - Removed `saveSession` calls from `signInWithPassword`
  - Removed `saveSession` calls from `signUpWithPassword`
  - Added automatic verification email sending on sign-up
  - Simplified OAuth functions to use `WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI` env var

### 2. ✅ Command Menu Not Mobile Friendly

**Problem**: Command menu showed keyboard shortcuts on mobile, where they don't work and take up valuable screen space.

**Solution**:
- Added `hidden sm:inline-flex` class to all `CommandShortcut` components
- Keyboard shortcuts now hidden on mobile (< 640px)
- Visible on tablet and larger screens
- Menu items remain fully functional on mobile
- Cleaner, more spacious mobile interface

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/command-menu.tsx`:
  - Updated all 16 `CommandShortcut` instances
  - Navigation group (7 shortcuts)
  - Quick Actions group (3 shortcuts)
  - Theme group (3 shortcuts)
  - Account group (2 shortcuts)
  - Sign out functionality maintains localStorage clearing

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow Now

1. **OAuth (Google/GitHub)**:
   - User clicks OAuth button
   - Redirected to provider
   - Provider redirects to `{domain}/callback` (from `WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI`)
   - Callback route handles auth and redirects to `/dashboard`
   - Uses correct domain from `request.url`

2. **Email/Password**:
   - User enters credentials
   - Server action validates with WorkOS
   - Returns success/error to client
   - Client handles redirect to dashboard or shows verification screen
   - No hardcoded redirect URIs

3. **Email Verification**:
   - Verification email automatically sent on sign-up
   - User guided to verification screen if needed
   - Proper error handling for unverified accounts

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Required for OAuth redirects
WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI=https://yourdomain.com/callback

# For local development
WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback
```

**Important**: Make sure your WorkOS dashboard has the correct redirect URIs configured for both development and production environments.

### Responsive Breakpoints

- **Mobile**: < 640px - No keyboard shortcuts shown
- **Tablet+**: ≥ 640px - Keyboard shortcuts visible

## Testing Checklist

### Authentication
- [ ] OAuth sign-in from localhost redirects to localhost dashboard
- [ ] OAuth sign-in from deployed site redirects to deployed dashboard
- [ ] Email/password sign-in works without localhost redirects
- [ ] Sign-up sends verification email
- [ ] Verification flow works correctly

### Command Menu Mobile
- [ ] Open command menu on mobile (< 640px)
- [ ] Verify no keyboard shortcuts visible
- [ ] All menu items still clickable and functional
- [ ] Open command menu on desktop
- [ ] Verify keyboard shortcuts visible
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts work as expected

### Sign Out
- [ ] Sign out from settings page
- [ ] Sign out from command menu
- [ ] Sign out from keyboard shortcut (⇧⌘Q)
- [ ] Confirm no redirect to localhost after sign out
- [ ] Verify localStorage is cleared
- [ ] Confirm stays on /auth after sign out

## Files Modified

1. `src/lib/workos/auth.ts` - Fixed authentication flow
2. `src/components/command-menu.tsx` - Mobile responsive shortcuts
3. `src/app/(app)/settings/page.tsx` - Added localStorage clearing (from previous fix)
4. `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx` - Added localStorage clearing (from previous fix)

## Notes

- OAuth redirect URIs must be configured in WorkOS dashboard
- Session management is now fully handled by WorkOS AuthKit
- Server actions return user data; client handles navigation
- Command menu remains fully functional on all devices
- Keyboard shortcuts hidden on mobile for better UX
- All linting errors resolved

## Before & After

### Before
```typescript
// ❌ Hardcoded redirect URI
await saveSession(session, "http://snooze.snowydev.xyz/callback");

// ❌ Shortcuts always visible
<CommandShortcut>⇧⌘D</CommandShortcut>
```

### After
```typescript
// ✅ No session management in server actions
return { success: true, user: {...} };

// ✅ Responsive shortcuts
<CommandShortcut className="hidden sm:inline-flex">⇧⌘D</CommandShortcut>
```

## Additional Improvements

- Automatic verification email sending on sign-up
- Better error messages for authentication failures
- Cleaner mobile command menu interface
- Consistent redirect behavior across environments
- Proper separation of concerns (server actions vs API routes)
